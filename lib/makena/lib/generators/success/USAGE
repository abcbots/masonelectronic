Description:

    Explain the generator

    Type: "success save"
    
    1. saves core, universal directories and files to a storage app called "success", 
    in a sibiling directory to the current app directory 
    (basically, if you are in /mycoolapp, the "success" is located at "../success").

Example:

    rails generate success save

    This will run:

    Reference: http://rubydoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions

    Where directory and add_file copy recursively files from current to "success" app in "../success" direcory

      directory "app", "../success/app"
      directory "config", "../success/config"
      directory "lib", "../success/lib"
      directory "public/themes", "../success/public/themes"
      copy_file "config/initializers/fog.rb", "../success/config/initializers/fog.rb"
      copy_file "config/application.yml", "../success/config/application.yml"
      copy_file "public/favicon.ico", "../success/public/favicon.ico"
      copy_file ".gitignore", "../success/.gitignore"
      copy_file "Gemfile", "../success/Gemfile"


    rails generate success fresh

      Does the reverse of save
      
      directory "../success/app/controllers/layouts_controller.rb", "app/controllers/layouts_controller.rb"
      directory "../success/app/views/layouts", "app/views/layouts"
      directory "../success/app/helpers/layouts_helper.rb", "app/helpers/layouts_helper.rb"
      directory "../success/app/helpers/layout_helper.rb", "app/helpers/layout_helper.rb"
      directory "../success/lib/generators", "lib/generators"
      directory "../success/public/themes", "public/themes"
      copy_file "../success/Gemfile", "Gemfile"
